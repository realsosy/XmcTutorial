# Standard Markdown

----------------------------------

## Headers

```no-highlight
# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6

Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:

Alt-H1
======

Alt-H2
------
```

## Emphasis

```no-highlight
Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

## Lists

```no-highlight
1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
  * Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
  1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.  

   Some text that should be aligned with the above item.

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
```

## Links

There are two ways to create links.

    [I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

    [I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

    [I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

    [You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

    Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself][]

    Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

    [arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
    [1]: http://slashdot.org
    [link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com

## Images

    Here's our logo (hover to see the title text):

    Inline-style:
    ![alt text](/assets/logo-white.png "Logo Title Text 1")

    Reference-style:
    ![alt text][logo]

    [logo]: /assets/logo-white.png "Logo Title Text 2"

![alt text](/assets/logo-white.png "Logo Title Text 1")

Reference-style:
![alt text][logo]

## Blockquotes

```no-highlight
> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.

## Inline HTML

You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well.

```no-highlight
<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>
```

<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>


## Horizontal Rule

```
Three or more...

---

Hyphens

***

Asterisks

___

Underscores
```

## Line Breaks

My basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to experiment and discover -- hit &lt;Enter&gt; once (i.e., insert one newline), then hit it twice (i.e., insert two newlines), see what happens. You'll soon learn to get what you want. "Markdown Toggle" is your friend.

Here are some things to try out:

```
Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.

## Tables

Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and Markdown Here supports them.

```
| header 1 | header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| cell 1   | cell 2   |
| cell 3   | cell 4   |
```

Code above produces next output:

| header 1 | header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| cell 1   | cell 2   |
| cell 3   | cell 4   |
